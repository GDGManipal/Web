<p id="para1">The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone , brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, 
generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states 
and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were
being built as early as the 7th century BCE;these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now
collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built 220–206 BCE by Qin Shi Huang, the first 
Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; 
the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
<p id="para2">The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was 
commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. 
The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal 
gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall</p>
<p id="para3">The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, in the 
United States. The copper statue, designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, a French sculptor, was built by Gustave Eiffel and 
dedicated on October 28, 1886. It was a gift to the United States from the people of France. The statue is of a robed female 
figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess, who bears a torch and a tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is 
inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue is an icon 
of freedom and of the United States, and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad.</p>
